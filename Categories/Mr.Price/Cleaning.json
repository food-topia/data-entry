The Orange scent not only smells delicious but helps with the cleaning too.\nAgain we went for a great quality spray nozzle to ensure a great spray pattern to cover more area so as its not just a small spray which encourages you to spray more product\nWe have discovered SurFACE is fantastic when used with a DRY CLOTH to leave a streak free shine when you just want to do a super quick clean.
